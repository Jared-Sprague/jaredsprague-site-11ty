The [East Coast Game Conference](https://ecgconf.com/) was a lot of fun! Michael and I gave a 6-hour hands-on workshop
where led the audience through building a game with entirely open-source gamedev tools.

## Abstract

Join us for a workshop on game jams and open-source game development tools.

Open-source tools have been lovingly crafted that cover every medium of game development. Through a series of hands-on
labs, we will introduce you to many of those tools, with a focus on using them for game jams.

Now, with your tools sharpened and a jam on the horizon, embark on your next #gamejam journey.
