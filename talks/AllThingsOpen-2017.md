I gave a talk at All Things Open 2017 about open source game development using [CLH Bash](https://arcade.redhat.com/bash)
game as an example. The room was packed with standing room only, which made me very happy to see how interested people
were on the topic!

## Abstract

Game development is more accessible than ever. Open-source tools have been lovingly crafted that cover every medium of
game development. Join us for a primer on open-source game development tools. Whether you're interested in game engines,
graphics, audio, or all of the above, we'll introduce the tools available. You'll also learn about game jams, the
perfect places to create your first games while meeting other game developers. Now, with your toolkit in hand and a game
jam in sight, you're ready to start your gamedev journey.
