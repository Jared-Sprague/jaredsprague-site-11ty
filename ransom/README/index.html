<h1>About the game</h1>
<p>This was my kids first game and I gave them complete creative control just to see what they came up with.<br>
I was very impressed with their creativity in art, music, and story.  My Daughter created all the art assets using<br>
a Wacom draw tablet and my Son composed all the original music from sheet music using <a href="http://noteflight.com">noteflight.com</a>.</p>
<p>There was more that we wanted to add like the ability to move the character around with a walking animation<br>
but we ran out of time.  We'll definitely be creating a post jam version.</p>
<p>This was also my first time using Phaser 3 and I really loved the experience compared to Phaser 2.</p>
<h1>Tools used</h1>
<p>We tried to use as many open source tools as possible creating this game.  Here is a complete list of tools used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phaser 3</li>
<li>Firealpaca</li>
